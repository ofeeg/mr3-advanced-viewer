# Installation


# Compilation
## Windows
Go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and install the version you need (most people need the 64-bit one) and run it. At the install prompt, just hit y and enter until finished.

After that, make sure you have Visual C++ installed and up-to-date, and then go to https://www.visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/  and install the Build Tools for Visual Studio. On its installation page, select Universal Windows  Build Tools, Desktop Development with C++, and .NET desktop build tools. After that, go into the command prompt and type:
```cd your\dir\name\here\```

When you type dir into the command prompt, you should see Cargo.toml. If you do, just type cargo build to build an executable!
